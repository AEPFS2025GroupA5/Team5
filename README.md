# Team5
During the spring semester, we were assigned to develop an application scenario for a hotel reservation system. This project builds on work from the previous semester, where we designed a database for the course "Datenbasierte Unternehmensanwendung".

As outlined in the project guidelines, we are using several tools to support our development process:
- Visual Paradigm for system modeling
- SQLite for the database
- DeepNote for documentation
- GitHub for version control and project management

In addition, we have been using Visual Studio Code (and Pycharm) to execute, push and pull codes into our repository.

You can access our DeepNote project via the following link: [enter link here].
